From Petr:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Generated 900K samples,
	\item Investigated possibilities for simplification: there appear to be no
		obvious ones,
	\item Reviewed $N$ surrogate models (fill in $N$), examined their behaviour
		on (un)constrained feature space and their scaling properties,
	\item Retrained some of the best-performing surrogates on large scale,
		achieved best accuracy $X$ and mean prediction time $X$, this amounts to
		relative speedup $X$ with respect to TBR MC model,
	\item All code is open-source; generated data, intermediate results and
		trained models are available online at $X$
\end{enumerate}
