Over the course of this internship project, we employed a broad spectrum of data analysis and machine learning techniques to develop fast and high-quality surrogate models for a MC TBR model in use at UKAEA.

After a thorough review of the literature, we developed a novel adaptive sampling algorithm, QASS, capable of interfacing with any of the individual studied models. Preliminary testing on a toy theory, qualitatively comparable to the MC TBR model, demonstrated the effectiveness of QASS and behavioral trends over its hyperparameters which are consistent with the design of the algorithm.
