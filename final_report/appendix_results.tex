TODO: include result figures for experiments

\begin{enumerate}
	\item experiment 1: per each surrogate class (row)
		show the accuracy metrics of the best instance, and mean times (+ std
		dev) over all instances
	\item experiment 2: same table as in experiment 1, but also include std dev
		of accuracy metrics of the concatenation of 20 best models per each
		slice (should show variation per slices), aggregate times over all
		instances in all slices
	\item experiment 3: one table per each metric and times, rows surrogate
		classes, columns training set sizes
	\item experiment 4: hyperparameters, metrics, and times of 8 presented models
\end{enumerate}
