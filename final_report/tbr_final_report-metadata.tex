\DISAbstract{%
 The tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is an essential quantity for the design of
 modern and next-generation Tokamak nuclear fusion reactors. Representing the
 ratio between tritium fuel generated in breeding blankets and fuel consumed
 during reactor runtime, the TBR depends in a
 complex manner on reactor geometry and material properties. We explored the
 training of surrogate models to produce a cheap but high-quality approximation
 for a Monte Carlo TBR model in use at the UK Atomic Energy Authority. We
 investigated possibilities for dimensional reduction on the feature space of
 this model, reviewed 9~families of surrogate models for potential
 applicability and performed hyperparameter optimisation. Here we present the
 performance and scaling properties of these
 models, the best of which demonstrated~$R^2=\num{0.998}$ and a mean
 prediction time of~$\SI{0.898}{\micro\second}$, representing a relative speedup of $8\cdot 10^6$
 with respect to the expensive MC model. We further present a novel adaptive
 sampling algorithm, QASS, capable
 of interfacing with any of the individual studied models. Our preliminary
 testing on a toy TBR theory has demonstrated the efficacy of this algorithm for
 accelerating the surrogate modelling process.
